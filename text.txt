Following text is a random sample text from a random text generator:

RSA is a #public-key encryption algorithm# and the standard for encrypting data sent over the internet. 
It also happens to be one of the methods used in our PGP and GPG programs.Unlike Triple DES, RSA is considered 
an asymmetric #algorithm due to its use of a pair of keys#. Youâ€™ve got your public key, which is what we use to 
encrypt our message, #and a private key to decrypt it. The result of RSA encryption# is a huge batch of mumbo 
jumbo that takes attackers quite a bit of time and processing power to break.
